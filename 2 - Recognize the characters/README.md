# 2 - Recognize the characters

**Hint**:

> Recognize the characters. Maybe they are in the book, but **MAYBE** they are in the page source.

**Solution**:

When we go to the page source code we'll find a **HUGE** comment at the bottom saying
us to find the _"rare characters"_ on the mess below ([characters.txt](https://github.com/pablotrinidad/pythonchallenge/blob/master/2%20-%20Recognize%20the%20characters/characters.txt)). The only thing we need to do
is to find the alphabetical characters which are already in order and we'll going to find the word **equality**.

# 2 - Recognize the characters

**Hint**:

> Recognize the characters. Maybe they are in the book, but **MAYBE** they are in the page source.

**Solution**:

When we go to the page source code we'll find a **HUGE** comment at the bottom telling us to find the _"rare characters"_ on the mess below ([characters.txt](characters.txt)). The only thing we need to do
is to find the alphabetical characters which are already in order. After finding all the characters 
we'll make the word **equality**.

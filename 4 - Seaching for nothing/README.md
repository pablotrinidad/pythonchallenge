# 4 - Searching for nothing

**Hint**:

After changing the `.html` extension for `.php` we'll find and image with a link pointing
to the same URL but adding the `nothing` argument with a _random_ number. And also a comment saying that if we try
to find nothing for 400 times it will be enough.

**Solution**:

Requesting the nothing URL manually will be an exhaustive way to do it, so we can write a script to follow the
nothings values until we get a response with the solution.
